Welcome to the community page for contributors! Here you will find resources to help you create even better documentation for XSK. 

## Contributor Guide

XSK is an open source project, which means that you can propose contributions by sending pull requests through [GitHub](https://github.com/sap/xsk).

Before you get started, here are some prerequisites that you need to complete:

### Legal Considerations

You must be aware of the Apache License (which describes contributions) and accept the Developer Certificate of Origin. This is common practice in major Open Source projects. To make this process as simple as possible, we are using [CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) for individual contributions. CLA assistant is an open source tool that integrates with GitHub very well and enables a one-click experience for accepting the CLA.

For  more information see the [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/sap/xsk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Style Guide

In this section we have outlined text stylizing options and for what elements they should be used. If everyone follows it, we will have visually consistent [documentation](https://github.com/sap/xsk/tree/gh-pages).
