## Details About the Parser
---

!!! warning "Caution"

    There are currently some [issues](https://github.com/SAP/xsk/issues/108) in the behavior of the HANA version 1.x of the parser:

    - Currently, the parser takes into accou—Ünt if a given property is mandatory.
    - If the property order is misplaced, the parser will still parse the values.
    - If more than one value of one property is provided, then only the last one is taken.
