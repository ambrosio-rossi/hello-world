## Overview
---

**Project XSK** is a compatible environment for applications based on [SAP HANA Extended Application Services](https://help.sap.com/viewer/52715f71adba4aaeb480d946c742d1f6/2.0.03/en-US/a6c0749255d84a81a154a7fc87dd33ce.html) (XS).

You can deploy it separately from a [SAP HANA](https://www.sap.com/products/hana.html?btp=991d50bf-fa15-4979-ac4b-b280b0eb951f) instance as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), on [Cloud Foundry](https://www.xsk.io/setup/cloud-foundry/), or even [locally](https://www.xsk.io/setup/) in standalone mode. The compatibility stack is an extension of the [Eclipse Dirigible](https://github.com/eclipse/dirigible) cloud development platform.

## Who Uses It?
---

If you have an **existing** [SAP HANA Extended Application Services](https://help.sap.com/viewer/52715f71adba4aaeb480d946c742d1f6/2.0.03/en-US/a6c0749255d84a81a154a7fc87dd33ce.html) (**XS classic application**), which currently runs on your SAP HANA database and you want to scale it out horizontally on a hyperscaler of your choice, XSK is your solution! It also provides the migration tooling for transferring the application code from your existing SAP HANA. By preserving the existing artifacts, APIs and development model, you can leverage your existing knowledge and experience to continue running existing applications and even to build new ones, if you want.
