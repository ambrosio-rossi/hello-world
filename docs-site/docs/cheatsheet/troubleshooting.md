## Two-Factor Authentication
---

If the migration fails to load **Delivery Units** and you are sure that you've provide correct information, please check whether your account has `Two-Factor Authentication` (2FA/MFA) enabled.
`Two-Factor Authentication` is currently not supported, more info could be found [here](https://github.com/SAP/xsk/issues/625).
You can use technical user without `Two-Factor Authentication` (2FA/MFA) enabled to complete the migration.
