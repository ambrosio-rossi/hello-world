# Create Delivery Units

A delivery unit (DU) is a group of transportable packages that contain objects used for content delivery. You can use the SAP HANA Application Lifecycle Management to create a DU for your application content or your software component.

    For more information, see [Create a Delivery Unit](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a4d43a319ecf464e9d838454a6bdb9ad/2.0.03/en-US/d5ca92aba6b4445aba17ca3f8d671217.html).

## Prerequisites

To create a delivery unit with the SAP HANA Application Lifecycle Management, you must ensure the following prerequisites are met:
    
- You have access to an SAP HANA system.
- You have the privileges granted by a role based on the SAP HANA `sap.hana.xs.lm.roles::Administrator` user role template.
- The `vendor` ID is defined for the DU; the vendor ID defines the repository namespace in which the new DU resides.

## Context

You use a DU to transport the design-time objects that are stored in the SAP HANA repository between two systems, for example, from a development system to a consolidation system. To create a new delivery unit using the SAP HANA application lifecycle management, perform the following steps.

## Steps

- Open SAP HANA Application Lifecycle Management.

    - SAP HANA Application Lifecycle Management is available on the SAP HANA XS Web server at the following URL: **`http://<WebServerHost>:80<SAPHANAinstance>/sap/hana/XS/lm`**

       - **Version**
       
        Version numbers must take the form `#.#.#`, for example, `1.0.5`, where:
   
           - `1` - the DU version number.
           - `0` - the support package version (if required).
           - `5` - the patch version (if required).

        !!! note

            The numbers you enter here refer to the application component that you are developing. The numbers do not refer to the patch or service-pack level deployed on the SAP HANA server.

   1. Choose **Create**.
   
    The new delivery unit is added to the SAP HANA repository in the namespace specified by the vendor ID and the application path.
